## **Theme:**
Retro by definition is â€œa style that is consciously derivative or imitative of trends, modes, fashions, or attitudes of the recent past. It generally implies a vintage of at least fifteen or twenty years. For example, clothing from the 1980s or 1990s could be retro."

RetroCade is a retro augmented reality experience in the palm of your hand. Using Vuforia, Retro Cade uses plane detection functionality in order to place down arcade machines of differing games to allow the user a retro like experience wherever they are.

VandyHacks 2020 Project - Retro theme.

We chose to integrate augmenter reality into Unity3D and adapt it for Android. The theme was retro inspired and allowed the user to explore a spacious fun arcade room and play on the machines.
