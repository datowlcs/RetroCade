# RetroCade / Press Start

## **Theme:**
Retro by definition is â€œa style that is consciously derivative or imitative of trends, modes, fashions, or attitudes of the recent past. It generally implies a vintage of at least fifteen or twenty years. For example, clothing from the 1980s or 1990s could be retro."
